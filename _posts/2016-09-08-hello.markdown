Thanks for checking in! You've reached yet another technical blog. This one is created and maintained by Erika Burdon, wannabe Software Engineer.

I've created this space in an effort to generate some tutorials on things that are difficult, and/or mildly confusing to learn with current resources. Things such as [Amazon Web Service's Elastic Map Reduce](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/). I used this service in a recent project, and it was bit of a doozy to master. A few friends of mine had a deep interest in using it themselves, but didn't have time to climb the learning curve. There may also be the occassional motivational posts on engineering and skill development. Content will come as I learn them in my own projects, all of which are hosted live on my website [erikaburdon.ca](http://erikaburdon.ca).

If you have any suggestions for blog posts, questions, or just feel like saying hi, <a href="mailto:erikaeburdon@gmail.com">feel free to reach out</a>!


### Who are you?

You may have guessed it already, but my name is Erika Burdon. I'll be graduating from the University of Victoria in Spring 2017 with a bachelor's in Software Engineering. I've got a problem with wanting to learn everything but no time to do it. I'm most interested in program architectures, especially with how third party libraries are integrated into systems.  I'm also a whiz at cooking and love to wakeboard. I'm deeply interested in music, puns, and living on the west coast. Also, cats.

### Upcoming content

Let's be honest. We're all very busy people and life sometimes takes over with busy-ness. There's overtime at work, and holidays coming up. Other times, you just don't want to do anything at all. That said, there's little worse than a dead blog. I hope to get at least 1 new post every 2 months. More likely, it'll be 1 post per quarter, but a girl can dream. Check back when you can, or send me an email to let me know you'd like a notification when something new is up.
