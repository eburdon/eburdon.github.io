Well. That didn't kick off too fabulously. In hindsight, it was probably a bad idea trying to start a development blog just as the holidays were ramping up, and work was closing down for the year. 

Let's start the second week of 2017 with a quick review of my project goals for the next year. The overarching one is to **git gud.** I know I have knowledge gaps in Computer Science and Software Engineering. Some should probably be fundamental at this point (binary trees, for example). I also don't deeply understand the caveats of developing in one browser over another (Chrome vs Edge), or what makes one language more powerful than another. I gotta fill these in.

## Projects

<br/>

As I mentioned way back when, I'd like to update this blog on a regular basis. That's still a goal. I suspect what stopped me over the holiday months was the idea that every post had to be this monolithic, complete thing with deep substance. Like a good hackathon project, I need to scale back the scope of my ideas and get stuff written! Adding to that, I'd like to develop a stronger stance on some engineering topics. I suspect I'm being too 'wishy-washy' about topics that seem to fire passionate debates online. This may come from those nusiance knowledge gaps! I'll do this by digging into those debates and continuing with my umbrella review of architectures, design, code smells, etc.

One of my *tangible* goals is to finish 1 / 2 current side projects: **[ClusterCooking](https://github.com/eburdon/erikaburdonAPI)**. I'm redoing my site's backend to support this (Pull request coming soon). It's an API written in Scala so I might learn some functional programming, with the intent of build an Android App and web interface to interact with it. It'll help you plan your meals for the week. So far, I've got the basic CRUD actions complete for two of the data models.

ClusterCooking has already been the source of several draft posts, so keep an eye out for those. Once I get V0.01 online and the code in the repo, I'll open them up for comments.

My other side project is a pseudo data-mining project of Facebook personal data anyone can download from their settings. Written in GO, this project started in my distributed systems course as an example of parallelizing data. I hope to implement at least one algorithm iterating over the data to provdide useful information, and to host the tool on [erikaburdon.ca](http://erikaburdon.ca). I don't think I'll get that one done this year, but a girl can dream.

## Shoutouts

<br/>

To close, I'd like to give a quick shoutout to some resources I found over the holidays that have helped me out.

### Dev.to

Curated by the folks behind [@ThePracticalDev](https://twitter.com/thepracticaldev), [DEV.to](https://dev.to/) is a space for any developer to "submit stories, tutorials, or anything worth discussing." So far, it's been a great community to hop into and chat with. With tons of social and technical posts, it was great reading when winding down.

### Alvin Alexander

I'd like to say thanks to [Alvin Alexander](http://alvinalexander.com/) and all his Scala tutorials! Definitely helped me resolve some issues I've had with ClusterCooking over the past month. I think I've used his site more than StackOverflow lately.

### Tech Ladies

I signed up for a [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/), a rather self-explanitory online community! They've got a private Facebook group which has already proven to be a great outreach resource. I've already had two positive experiences with them, one being their help desk addressing and updating their password policy based on a concern of mine. I'm curious what other people think about the exchange, so expect a post about that soon.

### Ben Halpern

I just really love his website. [Here](http://benhalpern.com/).
