Not a blog post. Just a link repository.

This is an evolving doc of links I think everyone will find useful at some point. I clear out my bookmarks pretty frequently. I need a glacier-style link repo for things I want access to once-a-season.

If you have useful links to add, feel free to make a Pull Request on this [Github blog repo](https://github.com/eburdon/eburdon.github.io).
